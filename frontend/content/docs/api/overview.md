# API overview

## Base URL

```
https://api.inference.club/v1
```

The `/v1` namespace mirrors the OpenAI API surface. Anything that speaks OpenAI — the official SDKs, Open WebUI, OpenRouter-style routers — can use this base URL with no other changes.

> Prefer an interactive reference? The **[API explorer](/api-reference)** renders the full OpenAPI spec with an "Authorize → Try it out" flow. The machine-readable spec is at [`api.inference.club/openapi.json`](https://api.inference.club/openapi.json).

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Modality |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/models` | List models you can reach (with capabilities). |
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | Text chat (and multimodal input where the model supports it). |
| `POST /v1/completions` | Legacy text completions. |
| `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` | [Speech-to-text](/docs/api/audio-transcriptions) — audio in, text out. |
| `POST /v1/images/generations` | [Image generation](/docs/api/images) — text in, image out. |
| `POST /v1/images/edits` | [Image edits](/docs/api/images) — image + prompt in, image out. |
| `POST /v1/audio/speech` | [Text to speech](/docs/api/speech) — text in, audio out. |

Each model on `/v1/models` reports `input_modalities`, `output_modalities`, `supported_features`, and a `service_type` (`llm`/`stt`/`image`/`tts`), so a client can tell the modalities apart and adapt its UI. A request is only routed to a service whose provider declared the matching `type` — a transcription never lands on a chat model, an image request never on a text model.

## Authentication

All `/v1/*` requests require a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

Get a key from **Dashboard → Settings → Token**. The same key authenticates both inference (`/v1/...`) and your agent's heartbeats (`/api/inference/agent/heartbeat/`).

Requests without a valid token return `401 Unauthorized`.

## Error format

Errors come back in OpenAI's error envelope:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "No online provider serving model 'qwen3-8b' for this user.",
    "type": "no_provider"
  }
}
```

Common types:

| `type` | When | HTTP |
|---|---|---|
| `no_provider` | The model you asked for isn't being served by any of your online providers right now | 404 |
| `upstream_error` | The agent's local LLM server returned an error or didn't respond | 502 |

Most other failures (auth, malformed JSON) come from Django REST Framework's defaults and use the standard `{"detail": "..."}` shape.

## Streaming

`/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/completions` honor the `stream: true` flag in the request body. The response is a Server-Sent Events stream of OpenAI-format delta chunks ending with `data: [DONE]`. Streaming passes through inference.club untouched, so the chunk shape is whatever your provider's local LLM server emits.

## Rate limits

There aren't any yet. There will be before this is publicly open.
